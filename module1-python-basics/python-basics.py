# 1. Print Statements:
# You can use the `print()` function to display information in Python.

print("Hello, World!")

# 2.  Variables and Data Types:
# Python supports various data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and more.

# Variables
age = 25
name = "John"

# Data types
num = 42        # Integer
pi = 3.14       # Float
text = "Hello"  # String

# 3. Comments:
# Use the '#' symbol to add comments in your code.

# This is a comment


# 4.  Indentation:
# Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. Typically, you use four spaces for each level of indentation.

if True:
    print("This is indented.")


# 5.  Conditional Statements:
# You can use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control the flow of your program.

# if condition:
    # Code to run if the condition is True
# elif another_condition:
    # Code to run if the first condition is False and this one is True
# else:
    # Code to run if none of the conditions are True


# 6.  Loops:
# Python supports `for` and `while` loops for iterating over data or running code repeatedly.

for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# while condition:
    # Code to run while the condition is True


# 7.  Lists:
# Lists are ordered collections of items, and they can contain different data types.

my_list = [1, 2, 3, "apple"]


# 8.  Functions:
# You can define functions to encapsulate reusable blocks of code.

def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")


# 9.  Input and Output:
# You can get input from the user using the `input()` function and display it using `print()`.

user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
print("You entered:", user_input)


# 10.  Error Handling:
#  Use `try` and `except` to handle exceptions and errors gracefully.
# try:
# Code that might raise an exception
# except ExceptionType:
# Code to handle the exception


# These are some fundamental concepts in Python. As you progress, you can explore more advanced topics like classes, modules, and libraries to build more complex programs.
