# Module 4: Object-Oriented Programming (1.5 hours)

## 4.1 Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (15 minutes)

### What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

- Explanation of the OOP paradigm
- Key principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction
- Real-world analogies to OOP concepts

### Classes and Objects

- Definition of a class and its role in OOP
- Creating objects from classes
- Understanding attributes (properties) and methods (functions) of objects
- Example: Creating a simple class and object

## 4.2 Inheritance and Polymorphism (30 minutes)

### Inheritance

- Explaining inheritance and its significance
- Creating subclasses and superclasses
- Overriding methods in subclasses
- Practical example of inheritance

### Polymorphism

- Understanding polymorphism and its benefits
- Polymorphism through method overriding
- Polymorphism through method overloading (optional)
- Use cases for polymorphism
- Practical examples showcasing polymorphism

## 4.3 Encapsulation and Data Hiding (20 minutes)

### Encapsulation

- Defining encapsulation and its purpose
- Access modifiers: public, private, protected
- Using accessors (getter methods) and mutators (setter methods)
- Demonstrating encapsulation with an example

### Data Hiding

- Explaining data hiding and its role in encapsulation
- Hiding data with private attributes
- Benefits of data hiding in OOP
- Example demonstrating data hiding

## 4.4 Constructors and Destructors (15 minutes)

### Constructors

- What are constructors, and why are they essential?
- Types of constructors: default and parameterized
- Writing constructors in Python classes
- Practical examples with constructors

## 4.5 Practical Examples and Exercises (15 minutes)

### Exercise 1: Building a Class Hierarchy

- Challenge: Create a class hierarchy with a base class and multiple derived classes. Implement inheritance and method overriding.

### Exercise 2: Encapsulation and Data Hiding

- Challenge: Create a class with private attributes and use accessor and mutator methods to access and modify the data.

### Exercise 3: Constructors and Destructors

- Challenge: Implement constructors and destructors in a class to manage resources efficiently.

## 4.6 Summary (5 minutes)

- Recap of key concepts covered in the module
- Emphasize the importance of OOP in Python and software development
- Encourage participants to practice and explore OOP further

**Note:** During this module, make sure to provide practical examples and code snippets to illustrate each concept. Encourage participants to follow along with coding exercises and provide opportunities for questions and clarifications.
