  - Syntax and basic examples
  - Use cases for lambda functions
  - How to use lambda functions with functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`

## 2. Decorators and Their Applications (15 minutes)

- Understanding **decorators** as a powerful feature for modifying or enhancing functions and methods
- Syntax for defining and using decorators
- Common use cases for decorators, including logging, authentication, and timing functions
- Creating custom decorators

## 3. Generators and Iterators (15 minutes)

- ### Generators

- ### Iterators

  - Understanding the concept of **iterables** and **iterators**
  - Implementing custom iterable objects and iterators
  - The `iter()` and `next()` functions
  - Use cases for custom iterators

## 4. Regular Expressions (Regex) (15 minutes)

- Introduction to **regular expressions (regex)** as a powerful tool for text pattern matching and manipulation
- Basic regex syntax (metacharacters, character classes, quantifiers)
- Practical examples of regex patterns for common tasks (e.g., email validation, phone number extraction)
- How to use Python's `re` module for regex operations

## 5. Practical Examples Demonstrating Advanced Concepts (20 minutes)

- Walkthrough of real-world examples that incorporate the advanced topics covered in this module
- Examples may include:
  - Using list comprehensions to filter and transform data
  - Creating decorators to log function execution time
  - Generating large datasets with generators
  - Validating and extracting data using regular expressions
- Encourage participants to follow along or try these examples on their own

## 6. Q&A and Discussion (10 minutes)

- Open the floor for questions and discussion related to the advanced topics covered in this module
- Address any specific challenges or questions raised by participants
- Provide additional resources for further learning, including books, websites, and tutorials on advanced Python topics

**Note:** Ensure that you provide clear and concise explanations for each advanced topic, with plenty of practical examples to reinforce understanding. Encourage participants to experiment with these concepts on their own and offer guidance on where to find more in-depth resources for each topic.
