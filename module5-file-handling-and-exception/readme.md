# Module 5: File Handling and Exceptions (1 hour)

## 5.1 Introduction to File Handling (10 minutes)

- In Python, file handling is essential for reading from and writing to files.
- Common file types include text files, binary files, and CSV files.
- You can use the `open()` function to interact with files in Python.

## 5.2 Reading from Files (15 minutes)

- The `open()` function with different modes (read, write, append, binary).
- Reading entire files with `read()`.
- Reading line by line with `readline()` and `readlines()`.
- Using `with` statements for automatic file closing.

## 5.3 Writing to Files (15 minutes)

- Opening files in write mode.
- Writing data to files using `write()` and `writelines()`.
- Appending data to files using append mode.
- Using context managers (`with`) for file writing.

## 5.4 Exception Handling (10 minutes)

- What are exceptions?
- Common exceptions in Python (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`).
- Using try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
- The `finally` block for cleanup actions.

## 5.5 Handling Specific Exceptions (15 minutes)

- Creating custom exception classes.
- Using multiple `except` blocks to handle different exceptions.
- Handling exceptions with meaningful error messages.
- Best practices for exception handling.

## 5.6 File Handling Best Practices (10 minutes)

- Properly closing files after use to avoid resource leaks.
- Using the `with` statement for automatic file closing.
- Error handling when working with files (e.g., handling file not found errors).
- Ensuring file permissions and file paths are correctly configured.

## 5.7 Practical Exercises (15 minutes)

- Hands-on exercises for reading and writing files.
- Reading data from a text file and processing it.
- Writing data to a new file and appending data to an existing file.
- Handling exceptions during file operations.

## 5.8 Additional File Handling Techniques (5 minutes)

- Using the `os` module for file and directory operations.
- Reading and writing binary files.
- Working with CSV files using the `csv` module.

## 5.9 File Handling Best Practices (Continued) (10 minutes)

- Best practices for working with different types of files (text, binary, CSV).
- Data validation and error handling when reading and writing files.
- Handling large files efficiently.

## 5.10 Q&A and Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

- Open the floor for questions related to file handling and exceptions.
- Summarize key takeaways from the module.
- Provide references to additional resources for further learning.

This content will provide participants with a solid foundation in file handling and exception handling in Python and should be accompanied by practical examples and exercises to reinforce the concepts.
