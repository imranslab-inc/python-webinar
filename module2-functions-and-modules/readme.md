# Module 2: Functions and Modules (1 hour)

## Section 1: Introduction to Functions (15 minutes)

- ### What Are Functions?

  - Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks.
  - They help organize code and make it more modular.

- ### Defining Functions

  - Syntax for defining functions: `def function_name(parameters):`
  - Parameters and arguments: Explanation of these concepts.

- ### Calling Functions

  - How to call a function with the appropriate arguments.

## Section 2: Parameters and Return Values (15 minutes)

- ### Parameters

  - Explain the role of parameters in functions.
  - Discuss default parameter values.

- ### Return Statements

  - How functions can return values using the `return` statement.
  - Examples of functions with and without return statements.

## Section 3: Scope and Global Variables (15 minutes)

- ### Scope of Variables

  - Explain local and global variable scope.
  - Describe the concept of variable shadowing.

- ### Global Variables

  - How to create and modify global variables within functions.
  - Best practices for using global variables.

## Section 4: Built-in Functions and Libraries (15 minutes)

- ### Built-in Functions

  - Introduce some commonly used Python built-in functions (e.g., `len()`, `input()`, `range()`).
  - Demonstrate how to use them in functions.

- ### Python Libraries

  - Mention the extensive standard library in Python.
  - Briefly introduce some popular libraries (e.g., `math`, `random`) and their purposes.

## Section 5: Creating Custom Modules (15 minutes)

- ### What Are Modules?

  - Explain what modules are and why they are useful.
  - Discuss the idea of code reusability through modules.

- ### Creating Your Module

  - Show how to create a Python module with functions.
  - Organize functions into modules for better code organization.
  
## Section 6: Practical Exercises (15 minutes)

- ### Provide a few hands-on exercises for participants to practice

  - Defining functions with various parameter types.
  - Using return statements in functions.
  - Working with global variables.
  - Creating and importing custom modules.
  
## Section 7: Q&A (15 minutes)

- Open the floor to questions from participants on the topics covered in Module 2.
- Encourage participants to ask about any challenges they faced during the practical exercises.

This content will give participants a solid understanding of functions in Python, including how to define, call, and work with them, as well as the concept of scope and the use of global variables. It also introduces them to the idea of creating and using custom modules, which is a fundamental concept in Python programming.
